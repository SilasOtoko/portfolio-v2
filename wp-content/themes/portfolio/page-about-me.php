      <p class="main-paragraph">I’ve been married to my wife, Hallie, for 4 years now. We have two kids and one more on the way. Hallie and I met in College where we were both going for Psychology degrees. I switched to Web Development a couple years after graduating and things have taken off for me since then.</p>

      <p>My kids' names are Benjamin and Gabriel. These guys keep us pretty busy, but they are also a joy to have and keep us plenty entertained. After a hard day at work they greet me at the door with happiness and little hugs and make it feel all worth it.</p>

      <p>I try to keep a good work/life balance so I can spend plenty of time with my wife and kids. Family is really important to me and although I know I’m competing with many young people who don’t have responsibilites like kids and can focus more on their careers, the desire to take care of my family keeps me motivated and I’m okay with taking things at a slower pace.</p>
