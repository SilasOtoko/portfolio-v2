              <p>While I was a data management intern, my boss mentioned that it would help if we could somehow show people outside the company that there were real people in the department that were ready to help. I was learning to be a Web Developer at the time and saw an opportunity to both keep myself busy at work and solve a problem. I apologize in advance for the disorienting, overzealous use of animations.</p>

              <p>In this website I tried to pay attention to matching the website colors with the business. The greenish color on the website is the same green as the front of the building. I took the main photo myself and touched up the paint job on the building in Photoshop.</p>

              <p>This one was interesting for me. I had spent many hours on this site, hours of my personal time outside of work as well, trying to get it just right. I had expected the guy to love it, but I learned a hard lesson: Just because it looks nice, doesn’t mean it is what the client wants. Turns out it pays to figure out what the client is looking for BEFORE building the website. He loved the logo I made for the site, though! He made it his official logo and even put it on a sign in front of his business. It is the one on the site, in the top left there. It was my first attempt at a logo. Yeah, that felt good.</p>

              <h4>The Wise Insurance Agency</h4>
              <p>This was my first experience in rescuing a site from someone else’s attempts. The company I worked for had hired someone on contract when things were busy. They regretted that pretty quickly, fired her, and asked me to fix it. Do you really need to know all that? Not really, but I was happy to have it turn out well in the end. Fun part was that the client had no idea about the turn of events and talked of how happy they were with the original developer’s work. This taught me that I need to keep my ego out of it, and just be happy that the client was happy, regardless of who had made the site in the end.</p>

              <p>I was very excited about this one. I had gone over to the client’s office photos, and found she had wonderful wall art made by a relative of hers that I ended up using for the site. It’s a bit eccentric but I like it.</p>
